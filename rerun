# USAGE:
#
#   rerun COMMAND
#
# Reruns COMMAND on every filesystem modify event in the current directory.
# Useful for things like running tests whenever you hit 'save' in your editor.
#
# COMMAND should be quoted or escaped to prevent your shell interpretting it
# before it reaches rerun. Single quotes will preserve the command exactly
# as you type it, e.g:
#
#   rerun 'echo $PWD && date'
#
# COMMAND may use $change, which is set to the name of the modified file on
# all but the first execution of COMMAND. e.g:
#
#   rerun 'echo modified file was $change'
#
# If COMMAND contains shell aliases, source rerun using a preceding dot:
#
#   . rerun COMMAND
#
# This is rerun2, because the original was written in Python,
# and was over-complicated, particularly in working with shell aliases.

# TODO: Can I avoid running `command` several times on a flurry of
# simultaneous events? I want one call of 'execute' to swallow all the
# events up to that point. Presumably I could put something inside the
# while loop that would skip calling 'execute' if the last call was too
# recent?

# TODO: I'd like to be able to press a key to rerun the command.
# Can I start a parallel process which calls 'execute' on each keypress?
